# Powerplant Coding Challenge Remastered
Engie's powerplant coding challenge remastered according to their feedback

## Objective
The objective was to calculate how much power each of a multitude of different powerplants need to produce (a.k.a. the production-plan) when the load is given and taking into account the cost of the underlying energy sources (gas, kerosine) and the Pmin and Pmax of each powerplant.

## Architecture
This solution is an ASP.NET Core RESTful Web API following the principles of Clean Architecture.
